# Sales Prediction App

This project is a Shopify app for predicting sales trends using Shopify's API and OpenAI's Language Model (LLM). The app integrates Shopify store data with AI to provide actionable insights into sales patterns and future projections. Below is an overview of the workflow and implementation steps.

## Project Features
- **Shopify API Integration**: Fetch store data like orders, products, and regions.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean, normalize, and aggregate data for analysis.
- **AI-Driven Predictions**: Use OpenAI's LLM to predict sales trends based on historical data.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Visualize predictions and insights using React and Shopify Polaris.
- **Scalable Deployment**: Host the app on AWS, Heroku, or another cloud platform.

## Workflow Overview

### 1. Project Setup
- Install Shopify CLI and initialize the app.
- Install required dependencies such as `express`, `openai`, and `@shopify/shopify-api`.

### 2. Authentication and API Setup
- Implement OAuth authentication for secure access to Shopify store data.
- Fetch historical sales data using the Shopify Admin API.

### 3. Data Preprocessing
- Extract key features from sales data, such as dates, sales amounts, and product information.
- Normalize and clean the data to remove inconsistencies.
- Aggregate data by time periods (daily, monthly, etc.).

### 4. LLM Integration
- Set up the OpenAI API for predictions.
- Craft structured prompts to provide sales data context for the model.
- Generate predictions for future sales trends.

### 5. Visualization and UI
- Use React and Shopify Polaris to create an intuitive dashboard.
- Integrate data visualization libraries like Chart.js or D3.js for trend analysis.
- Display predictions and actionable insights.

### 6. Deployment
- Host the app on AWS, Heroku, or another cloud platform.
- Test the app thoroughly and debug as needed.
- Submit the app to the Shopify App Store.
